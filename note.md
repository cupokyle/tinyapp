The order of route definitions matters! The GET /urls/new route needs to be defined before the GET /urls/:id route. Routes defined earlier will take precedence, so if we place this route after the /urls/:id definition, any calls to /urls/new will be handled by app.get("/urls/:id", ...) because Express will think that new is a route parameter. A good rule of thumb to follow is that routes should be ordered from most specific to least specific.
